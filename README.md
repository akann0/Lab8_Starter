# Lab 8 - Starter

1. You should run your automated tests in a GitHub action,
as this will prevent bad code from being pushed while saving
everyone involved the effort of testing locally.

2. No

3. You would not write a unit test for a messaging feature becuase
a messaging feature is very complex, whereas unit tests are supposed
to test small and simple tasks

4. You would write a unit test to test a character limit for a messaging app
because this feature is small enough in scope that it makes sense to test
with a unit test.
